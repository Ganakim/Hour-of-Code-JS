Using JavaScript, it's possible to create games similar to the arcade classics of days bygone!

In this game, you control a paddle with the arrow keys to bounce a ball and keep it from falling while busting the blocks at the top of screen.

But when you open it, nothing works! The scene is there, but the ball drops and immediately goes through the paddle, which you can't even control.

There are several places that you'll need to add JavaScript code in the script.js file, so open up the instructions and get started!

You'll be adding code to do the following:
    - Check if the ball hits a block, what happens in this case?
    - Check if the ball hits the walls of the game, what should happen?
    - Check if the ball hits the paddle, what should happen?
    - Check if the paddle hits the walls, what should happen?
    - What happens when the arrow keys are pressed? What about when the player stops pressing them?

What you're learning:
    - Using "switch" and "if" conditionals
    - How to apply functions to objects
    - How to use parameters 
    - How to use properties and booleans in conditionals 

Bonus activities:
    - In the script.js file under the removeLife constant, you'll see a bunch of red and black heart emojis that track your life. 
        - Can you replace these heart emojis with something else to keep track of lives?
    - In the setup.js file, you can go to the Game class and change some fundamental variables in this game.
        - Double the width, and start the game with 4 rows instead. What happens? 
    - After finishing building the game, can you figure out which properties affect the Ball object's speed? Go to the setup.js file and the Ball class.
        - Change the ball's speed to make the game easier or harder. What happens when you change the other variables here?

How to set up:
    In this zip file there are three folders, a PDF file, and this instructional text.
    What do you do with each of these?
        Images folder
            Images for the PDF are stored here.
        Solution folder
            The completed answer key for the script.js file is stored here. Don't give this to the ninjas!
        PDF
            Instructions for the ninjas to follow to build their game.
        Brick Breaker folder 
            This contains all of the files to run the game, 1 html file and 2 JavaScript files.
            Game.html
                Open this file to run the game itself. This file can also be opened in a code editor to adjust how the game behaves.
            setup.js
                Open this file in a code editor to adjust how the game behaves. Ninjas will need to open this for some bonus activities.
            script.js
                Open this file in a code editor to add the code for the core of this activity and to adjust how the game behaves.
    What do I need to run this activity?
        Ninjas need the contents of the Brick Breaker folder and the PDF instructions. 
        They will also need a code editor or text editor. Visit CNU for our code editor recommendations!
        Have the ninjas open the PDF for their instructions, and all 3 of the files in the Brick Breaker folder in their code editor.
